This includes demystification of the institutions and social relations that not only make for painful everyday life experiences, but that immiserate human beings across the complex and interwoven spheres of race, class, gender and sexuality as well as exploit and dominate the planet&#8217;s scarce human and natural resources.    <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We support direct action and direct democracy for a society that is decentralized, self-reflective and self-limiting, a society where individuals and groups have decision-making say over the things that affect them. In other words, we envision a technologically advanced autonomous society that is based on direct democracy.  <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This about page helps explain, in broad strokes, the &#8216;Who&#8217;, &#8216;What&#8217;, &#8216;Where&#8217; and &#8216;Why&#8217; of Autonomy or Barbarism, &#8216;A or B&#8217; for short.
