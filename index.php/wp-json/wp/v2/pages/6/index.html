It may also be a group of autonomous groups that together form a region or transnational group.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In its broadest sense, A or B supports direct action and direct democracy for an autonomous society. This translates to supporting efforts across the totality of social relations against bureaucracy and oppression in all its guises. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Where<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p> A or B groups exist in Oxford, London&#8230;. We exist in communities, workplaces, online, and offline. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, why A or B? If you feel tired, stressed, bored, ill, disempowered, scared for your life, dispossessed, worried about your future and the future of your loved ones and future generations; if the big and small decisions made by politicians don&#8217;t make much, <em>if any<\/em>, sense at all to you; if you&#8217;re fleeing persecution, struggling to pay the bills, can&#8217;t ever really afford a break, much less an actual vacation, and know everything your boss or line manager seeks to &#8216;enlighten&#8217; you about, then you likely already understand the reason &#8216;why&#8217; at a very deep level. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A or B is here to offer solidarity and work to help demystify the forces that entrench social and material misery and alienation. This includes demystification of the institutions and social relations that not only make for painful everyday life experiences, but that immiserate human beings across the complex and interwoven spheres of race, class, gender and sexuality as well as exploit and plunder the planet&#8217;s natural resources with an eye to unlimited expansion and rational mastery of scarce human and natural resources.    <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why we support direct action and direct democracy. Our vision is for a society that is decentralized, self-reflective, and directly democratic society where individuals and groups have decision-making say over the things that affect them. In other words, a society that is radically democratic, self-limiting, self-organised and classless.  <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This about page helps explain, in broad strokes, the &#8216;Who&#8217;, &#8216;What&#8217;, &#8216;Where&#8217; and &#8216;Why&#8217; of Autonomy or Barbarism, &#8216;A or B&#8217; for short.
